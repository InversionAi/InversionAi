![Inversion Logo](assets/logo.png)

## Project Overview
Inversion is an AI-driven future simulation system combined with blockchain technology. Our vision is to help users preview and optimize their life trajectories through AI simulation, while building a token-based future exploration community.

## Core Features
- Future Diary: Preview your future experiences
- Future Self Dialogue: Interact with AI-generated future versions of yourself
- Dynamic Future Rewriting: See how your choices impact your future
- Future Exploration Mode: Simulate different life paths

## Technical Architecture
The project is built with a modern tech stack focusing on AI, blockchain, and web technologies.
